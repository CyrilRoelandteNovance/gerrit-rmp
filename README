What is gerrit-rmp?
-------------------
Are you tired of manually adding reviewers to your patches in gerrit?
Gerrit-rmp (Review My Patch!) allows you to add a pre-defined set of reviewers
to one of your reviews.

Start by writing a config file as the one described in config.sample, then run:

    $ ./add_reviewers.py config <gerrit remote>

You will be prompted with a list of your patches and will be able to select
one. Gerrit-rmp will then add all the reviewers specified in the config file to
the review. Congrats, you avoided a shitload of clicks in a Web interface, and
never had to leave the comfort of your 80x24 terminal!



Known issues
------------
- Only Python 3 is supported: it's a feature, not a bug.
- The error handling is terrible: it is indeed.
